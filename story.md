## backstory
Over the course of many many centuries...

The castle dwellers discover magic.

They learn its power quickly, and how to extract mana from mana wells.

Mana is a rare substance that the dwellers become dependent on.

There are subtle side effects to themselves and the world, burning mana at the
higher and higher rates they demand increases these effects

The castle dwellers became hungrier and hungrier for power

The effects of burning mana were dire, slowly it caused their material world
to disintegrate, mana ghosts spawned and walked the world

The castle dwellers wanted to stop, but could not help themselves

Eventually their world became so toxic and hostile they were forced to flee

They sent their castle through time, space, and across planes

Where it landed in your city.

## situation
Many of the workers in the castle were either peasants owned by the higher
status people of the castle, or hired workers. In both cases these citizens
were not magic users.

There are many lost people from your city in the castle.

There is a language barrier, but it can be bridged with a companion, later you
can learn the language if you desire to

## story beats

- player comes across more creatures like the companion creature, there is some
drama about your friend helping you, the creature seems to be exiled for his
actions

- player defeats the big bad wizard

- a survivor becomes big bad number 2, insisting that humanity uses this new
found magic to benefit humanity

- friendly mana ghost plays the part of the natural order, says mana was never
meant to be used as it is now

- the friendly mana ghost shows the player a vision of what will happen to
humanity if mana is brought to the modern world

- ending: player brings mana to the modern world, lives happily ever after, but
dooming the future of the human race to corruption. The mana is a boon to
civilization at first, cancer is cured, the merging of computers and magic
creates new machines that benefit humanity immensely, but in time, humanity
suffers the same fate as the castle dwellers. This is worse, since humanity
takes to the stars, and soon the whole galaxy is inflicted with mana lust

- ending: player destroys the mana well in the castle, humanity lives on their
natural life
