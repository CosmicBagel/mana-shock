## backstory
Over the course of many many centuries...

The castle dwellers discover magic.

They learn its power quickly, and how to extract mana from mana wells.

Mana is a rare substance that the dwellers become dependent on.

There are subtle side effects to themselves and the world, burning mana at the
higher and higher rates they demand increases these effects

The castle dwellers became hungrier and hungrier for power

The effects of burning mana were dire, slowly it caused their material world
to disintegrate, mana ghosts spawned and walked the world

The castle dwellers wanted to stop, but could not help themselves

They sent their castle through time, space, and across planes

There are many lost people from your city in the castle.

can learn the language if you desire to
